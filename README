This project provides an easy and solid way to add expanding more/less functionality to a div with lots of text.  Any text overflowing the normal height of the div will be removed to the nearest word, and an ellipsis will be appended and a more/less button added.  If the text in your div does not exceed the height of the div, the div will look as usual.


/***** Usage ******/

Be sure to include the mlOverflow.js file, as well as jQuery 1.7.2 or above.

Add the class "mlOverflow" to any divs you want to use.

Add the class "mlOverflow_text" to the element whose height you want to expand the parent div to (usually a p tag).

Optionally, add a mlOverflow_more and/or mlOverflow_less data attribute to your mlOverflow div.  These values will override the default "More" and "Less" strings to whatever you want your button to say.

Check out the live example linked to above if you need to see an example, or the blog post for a more detailed description.
